## Roadblocks
- Trying to recreate TypeForm, we wanted to seamlessly transition to the next question without the user "clicking" - trigger when the user hit enter. Solution:
```javascript
onKeyDown="if(event.keyCode==13) location.href='#apply3';"
```

Change `http://resources.infolinks.com/js/infolinks_main.js` to `//resources.infolinks.com/js/infolinks_main.js` or `httpS://resources.infolinks.com/js/infolinks_main.js`
